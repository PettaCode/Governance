                                Each level of office postition has thier own position and permession to their work. The time management what we trying here is different. Though Goverment has the time limit for each service that is not so efficient so we take a different approach inside the system the time actuly less than the actual nominees mensioned by the Goverment by this the efficiency can be calculated easily. This step is for avoiding the corrosion even getting started. We hope this will change lot.
